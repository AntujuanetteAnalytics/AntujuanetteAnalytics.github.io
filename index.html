											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p> When collecting, normalizing, analyzing, and visualizing data, an agile and precise approach is used to maintain integrity along side productivity. Likewise, understanding the ETL process from Data Lakes to Data Warehouses aids in conducting complex analyses that generate insights which drive business decisions. <br/> 
											In addition, collaboration between different departments is seamless, resulting in understanding business objectives and translating them into data-driven solutions. As an experienced writer, storytelling with data presents insights with simple efficiency. Moreover, adaptive learning makes integrating new technologies and techniques intriguing yet seamless.</p>

												<h2>Pizza Sales: KPIs and Insight</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image left stick"><img src="images/pic1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>I imported the CSV file into SQL creating a query for KPIs that I utilized in Excel.<a href="https://github.com/AntujuanetteAnalytics/AnalyticProjects/blob/main/PizzaSales_SQL%20Queries.pdf"> Click Here</a> to see the SQL query.</p>
											The insights extracted from this data set give valuable information on general business KPIs that stakeholders can utilize to track the general growth of the company over the last year. Filtering the visuals by quarter, month(s), week(s), or day(s) provides an in-depth understanding of the trends that are direct contributions to the business's success.<br/>
											<p>Trends that I found intriguing were:</p>
											<p>--Orders peaked on Thursdays/Fridays around 12 PM-1 PM with a following influx at 5 PM-6 PM.</p>
											<p>--Classic paves way slightly ahead of the opposing categories, making up roughly 26% of sales while large dominates as the most demanding, contributing to 46% of sales per size.</p>
											<p>--Classic Deluxe pizza sets the bar with 2,432 sales while the contrasting Brie Carre is hardly relevant with 490 sells.</p>
											<p>A few data-driven suggestions I would make is to open the Pizza Shop later as the data shows nine pizzas sold between 9 AM and 11 AM for the entire calendar year. I would also suggest selling the Brie Carre seasonally or removing it from the menu.</p>

												<h2>Mental Health in Tech Survey: Data Wrangling</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image right stick"><img src="images/Tech Mental Health.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>I did a deep data wrangling in SQL. Below explains my thinking and process.
												<p>--WHERE IS NOT NULL-There were quite a few NULL values in the dataset. After contemplating the impact of excluding these samples, filtering out the missing data appeared to be the soundest option. To accomplish this, I used WHERE IS NOT NULL excluding columns: Comment as this is optional and State due to some respondents being international.</p>
												<p>--UPDATE- This statement was used for cleaning uo the values. E.G. Much of the gender column was free form and had multiple answers. For accuracy, I used the UPDATE statement to group similar values. I employed deductive reasoning to sort misspelled or incomplete data.</p>
												<p>--SELECT INTO/CREATE TABLE- After filtering the NULLS, I was left with a brand-new table. I used SELECT INTO to create a #TEMPTABLE but found that to be inconvenient. Employing SELECT INTO again, I created a permanent table in the database.</p>
												<p>--EXEC SP_RENAME: The column names were vague and lacked uniformity. To make the names relational to the column values, I used the stored procedure, EXEC SP_RENAME, to clean them up.</p>

											<h2>Location Performance: Dashboard and Written Presentation</h2>
										</header>
										<span class="image left stick"><img src="images/Tableau.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>I was given the task to pinpoint the underperforming locations. Kansas and Hawaii have the lowest sales/revenue. One reason for this is the number of customers each location has obtained. Although the amount of sells differ by a few purchases, revenue for Hawaii is noticeably higher than Kansas. This stands out as abnormal in a data set that has a consistent pattern. After shifting through the noise, seasonal values appear to have a similar abnormal trend. Spring has the highest sells; however, Fall has more revenue.</p> 
										By calculating the average, it shows that the price for items in Fall are just a hair higher than the average item price in Spring. Prior to validating my observations, I made a brisk data driven hypothesis. My forecast is that Hawaii's demanding season is Fall and after cross referencing, this was confirmed. Hawaii's profitable season is in sync with the profitable time of year for the company which fills the sell/revenue gap.</p>
										<p>With these insights, a data-based suggestion would be to spotlight footwear in Kansas. It's the second highest priced category and for Kansas it's a decent consumer attraction. The key is to target market the footwear during Spring. Yes, Fall is highest in revenue however, Spring already has momentum in the Kansas market. In this scenario, jumping into an already flowing stream is more efficient than redirecting it.</p>

												<h2>Def decode(message_file): Python Function</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image right stick"><img src="images/Python.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>The function is called decode and requires an argument (message_file). Replace the example argument with the variable that holds the file path.</p>
											<p>The column is split, and a second column is created for the seperate value. The value in column 0 is considered a string data type and needs to be converted to numeric so it can be sorted in consecutive, ascending order.</p> 
											<p>Once done, convert columns to lists.  Variable 'i' holds the number of times it iterates through the length of Messages, starting at 1. Index provides the starting point, then creates the end point of the slice by combining with 'i', generating columns and rows.</p>
											<p>The 'if' statement removes empty lists and the value of index is increased by 'i' before looping back through. A list of the extracted words is created from and they are joined into a string. If the number of iterations doesn't equal the number of words in messages, invalid_range is returned.</p>
